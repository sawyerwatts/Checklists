# System

- What is the purpose, abstract, or problem statement of this system?
- If possible, determine an estimated load and acceptable latency. Ensure the
system is performant enough to achieve that throughput.
- Have a strategy in place to allow devs to easily 1) establish correctness and
2) ensure correctness is preserved after making changes.
    - Automated testing is usually the answer here.

## Credentials

- Ensure the system can handle changing utilized credentials with ease.
