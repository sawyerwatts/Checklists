# Scalability and SLA

- [ ] How would this operation cause the app to run out of memory or disk?
- [ ] How many requests per second?
- [ ] What is an estimated load over a period of time (the throughput)?
    - [ ] ops, reads, or writes per second
    - [ ] How many daily active users (DAU) (or targets per batch, etc) are
    expected?
- [ ] What is an acceptable latency or max run duration?
- [ ] Ideally, criteria for load and stress testing can be identified as well.
- [ ] What is an acceptable availability?
- [ ] What alerting is in place when an SLA is at risk or breached?
- [ ] What is the storage capacity?
- [ ] Is there a start-by time or a start-at time?
- [ ] Is there an end-by time or an end-at time?
