# Checklists

In early 2024, Sawyer started reading *Code That Fits in your Head*, which
argues that developers should have checklists to help ensure they do not forget
important aspects of the software development lifecycle. As such, this repo is
Sawyer's collection of checklists.

Sawyer is a backend developer that primarily writes web APIs and console/batch
applications, and occassionally writes CLI tools. This is the perspective these
checklists are written from.
