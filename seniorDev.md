# Senior Dev

## Demeanor

Ultimately, be constructive, forward-looking, approachable, and supportive.

You want other devs to want to work with you and come to you with questions and problems, and you
want them to be engaged and supported.

- When they bring something up, always appreciate their energy and drive
- When reviewing PRs, compliment things
- If they aren't multitasking, consider asking for their opinions
- If it isn't critical, it's probably worth letting them do things there way. Otherwise you'll be
paying in good will.
- When answering questions, make sure to read all of the question and try to answer the underlying
question.
- Social capital / reputation is real. Be consious of how you are gaining and spending it.

## Recurring Activities

- Daily and sprintly, when evaluting what was done over the period, also consider what others have
done to give them kudos
- Every now and then, try to observe how much someone has grown and kudos them for that too
- Check-in and help them target skills and grow as devs
- Periodically prompt for feedback, esp around code reviews
