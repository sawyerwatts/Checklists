# Senior Dev

## Demeanor

Ultimately, you want other devs to want to work with you and come to you with questions and
problems, and you want them to be engaged and supported. You don't want to be one of Those
devs/architects.

- Be constructive, forward-looking, and approachable
- When reviewing PRs, compliment things
- If they aren't multitasking, consider asking for their opinions
- If it isn't critical, it's probably worth letting them do things there way. Otherwise you'll be
paying in good will.
- When answering questions, make sure to read all of the question and try to answer the underlying
question; avoid being one of Those devs/architects.
- Social capital is real. Be consious of how you are gaining and spending it.

## Recurring Activities

- Daily and sprintly, when evaluting what was done over the period, also consider what others have
done to give them kudos
- Every now and then, try to observe how much someone has grown and kudos them for that too
- Check-in and help them target skills and grow as devs
- Periodically prompt for feedback, esp around code reviews
